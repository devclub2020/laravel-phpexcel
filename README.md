If you try to use PDF writer you will get this warning :

PDF Rendering library has not been defined

You need to install a renderer and then go to

/bundles/laravel-phpexcel/PHPExcel/Settings.php

and alter these element

	/**
	 * Name of the external Library used for rendering PDF files
	 *		e.g.
	 *			mPDF
	 *
	 * @var string
	 */
	private static $_pdfRendererName = "domPDF";

	/**
	 * Directory Path to the external Library used for rendering PDF files
	 *
	 * @var string
	 */
	private static $_pdfRendererPath = "/Applications/MAMP/htdocs/dataman/public/dompdf/";

I have used domPDF. Obviously alter the path to wherever you install domPDF
n.b. i tried mPDF but had errors in it's code.
